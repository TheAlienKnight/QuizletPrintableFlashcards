# QuizletPrintableFlashcards

### About
Originally this was aimed at replacing the flashcard print function Quizlet had, but I branched off to add a few more features.

### Why?
I needed the ability to print on 3x5, and 4x6 notecards. I then learned, teachers used Quizlets printable flashcard function often, and when it was removed, no other real alternative came about. So I made one.
